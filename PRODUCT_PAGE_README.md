## Data Structure

Each cake object contains:
```typescript
interface Cake {
  id: number;           // Unique identifier
  name: string;         // Cake name
  type: string;         // Cake category (Chocolate, Velvet, etc.)
  description: string;  // Detailed description
  price: number;        // Price in USD
  img: string;          // Image URL
}
```

## Current Cake Types
- Chocolate
- Velvet
- Fruit
- Chocolate & Fruit
- Citrus

## Usage

### Basic Display
The Product page automatically loads and displays all available cakes when the component mounts.

### Filtering
Users can click on filter buttons to view cakes of specific types:
- **All Cakes**: Shows all available cakes
- **Chocolate**: Shows only chocolate-based cakes
- **Velvet**: Shows only velvet cakes
- **Fruit**: Shows fruit-based cakes
- **Chocolate & Fruit**: Shows cakes with both chocolate and fruit
- **Citrus**: Shows citrus-flavored cakes

### Ordering
Each cake card has an "Order Now" button (currently a placeholder for future functionality).

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state
- Manages loading states and filtered results

### Data Fetching
- Currently uses local data with simulated API delays
- Service layer prepared for future API integration
- Error handling for failed requests

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Custom CSS for text truncation (`line-clamp-3`)
- Consistent color scheme matching the existing design

### Animations
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Staggered animations for cake cards
- Hover effects and transitions

## Future Enhancements

### API Integration
The service layer is prepared for real API integration:
```typescript
// Replace simulated calls with real API calls
const response = await fetch('/api/cakes');
return response.json();
```

### Additional Features
- Search functionality
- Price range filtering
- Sorting options (price, name, popularity)
- Shopping cart integration
- User reviews and ratings
- Cake customization options

### Performance Optimizations
- Pagination for large datasets
- Image lazy loading
- Caching strategies
- Virtual scrolling for very long lists

## Dependencies

- **React 19**: For component functionality
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and transitions
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience

## Getting Started

1. The Product page is automatically included in the main App component
2. No additional setup required - it will load automatically
3. Data is fetched on component mount
4. Filtering is handled client-side for optimal performance

## Customization

### Adding New Cakes
Add new cake objects to `src/data/cakes.ts`:
```typescript
{
  "id": 6,
  "name": "New Cake Name",
  "type": "New Type",
  "description": "Description here",
  "price": 28.99,
  "img": "image-url-here"
}
```

### Modifying Styles
Update Tailwind classes in `ProductPage.tsx` or add custom CSS to `src/index.css`.

### Changing Animations
Modify Framer Motion properties in the component for different animation effects.
